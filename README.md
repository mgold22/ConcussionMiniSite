# ConcussionMiniSite
A repository to host CDC's Heads Up Mini Site
This site is intended to host the embed code supplied by the CDC Heads Up program for hosting their Mini-site on concussions. This page will then be linked in an iframe into the Mass.gov webpages where concussion prevention and response information is desired.
